  Today I'm very proud to introduce <a href="http://cartalogapp.com">Cartalog</a>. I've spent the past months working on it with my heart and soul and I think that it's the best catalog creation and viewing experience on the iPad. 
</p>
<p>
  The focus of this application is on making it easy for anyone to simply take an iPad, gather your photographs and images of your products and put it all together in a beautiful catalog fashion, lock it all in a single document and be ready to just hand over the iPad to a customer. It's that simple!
</p>
<p>
  With multitouch gestures, gorgeous transitions and animations Cartalog makes it very intuitive to see what's happening on the screen. Not to mention the ability to use great full-screen images for your products and really reel those customers in.

  So what are you waiting for? Go on to <a href="http://cartalogapp.com">visit the Cartalog site</a> to see a video of it in action.
