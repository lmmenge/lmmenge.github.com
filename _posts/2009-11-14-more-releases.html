  Now Brazilians can also download Undead Attack! Pinball! I'm so happy to announce that we've
  made it available on the App Store this Saturday, the 14th. You can <a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/br/app/undead-attack-pinball-br/id338742753?mt=8">click here (iTunes link)</a> to get it.

  On a side note, a small project of mine went online as well: <a href="itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twisthelper/id336656374?mt=8">TwistHelper (iTunes link)</a> replaces the standard
  Twister&tm; spinner so that you can play the very same game but with a smarter spinner.
  It'll never move the same limb twice in a row and it knows where your limbs should be, so it
  both tells you the current game state so you can catch cheaters and it won't ever move a limb
  to a color that it already is on!
