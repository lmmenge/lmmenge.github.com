  Earlier this month I released <a href="http://lmmenge.github.io/savemyfiles">Save My Files</a>. Save My Files is a simple, straightforward app designed with one simple function: making your files available on your iPhone or iPad at any time.
</p>
<p>
  Save My Files offers a fast and direct way to download your files from the internet or copy them over through iTunes and keep them for offline viewing with its beautiful Image, Video and Music viewers.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have all your content at your fingertips without the need for an internet connection, you'll fall in love! Just copy the links and open Save My Files. It's that simple!
</p>
<p>
  So what are you waiting for? Go on to <a href="http://lmmenge.github.io/savemyfiles">visit the Save My Files site</a> to see a video of it in action.
